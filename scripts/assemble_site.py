"""Assemble the published site: the landing page at the root, the docs beneath it.

    scripts/assemble_site.py --out _site
    scripts/assemble_site.py --self-test

WHY THIS EXISTS. The docs moved from `/azure-keyvault-emulator/<slug>/` to
`/azure-keyvault-emulator/docs/<slug>/`, which is the shape the rest of the
family uses. That moved **24 published routes**, and a moved URL is a 404 for
every link already pointing at it: this project's own README, anything in the
sibling repositories, and anything outside them nobody can enumerate. Grepping
the family found only two such links, both in this repository's README. The
links nobody can grep are the reason for this file.

So every old path gets a redirect stub here, and the stubs are not optional
politeness: `website/published-routes.txt` is the route list captured from the
build immediately BEFORE the move, and this script fails if any entry in it
would 404. That file is the oracle. Deriving the check from the new build
instead would only prove the new build agrees with itself.

ASTRO'S `redirects:` CANNOT DO THIS. A redirect key is emitted underneath the
configured base, so after the move `/01-quickstart/` publishes at
`/azure-keyvault-emulator/docs/01-quickstart/` and nothing answers the
root-level path anyone actually linked to. The stubs must be written outside
Astro, which is here.

THE BADGES STAY AT THE ROOT, and are written by the workflow after this script
runs, because the coverage percentage is measured there. This script clears the
output directory, so nothing may be written into it beforehand.
